# Spring-DynamoDB-Integration-DEMO
This repository is used to demonstrate how to integrate DynamoDB AWS SDK into Java Spring Boot framework <br>

Postman sample CURLs are in the folder: /resources/postman. Do not forget to import to your own postman. <br>

And you just need to clone the code and modify application.properties file to replace the AWS credentials and DynamoDB region with yours. Then you could start this application.<br>

The detailed information could refer to my blog the  [medium blog](https://medium.com/@sudacgb/message-queue-a-complete-guide-aa956ada2e98) . <br>
